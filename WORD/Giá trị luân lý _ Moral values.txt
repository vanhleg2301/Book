Moral values refer to the principles and beliefs that guide individuals and societies in determining what is right and wrong, good and bad, and ethical or unethical in human behavior. These values serve as a foundation for moral judgments and decisions, influencing how people interact with others and make choices in various situations.

Moral values are often derived from cultural, religious, or philosophical sources and are deeply ingrained in individuals through socialization processes. They provide a framework for individuals to evaluate their actions, consider the consequences, and make ethical decisions. Some common moral values include:
